## About Me

Hi there! I'm **Kensuke**!

I'm an Information Systems student at the University of Utah (expected graduation Spring 2026) passionate about leveraging data to build intelligent solutions. I have a strong foundation in **Data Analysis**, **Data Science**, and **Machine Learning**, and I am **actively learning and exploring AI concepts**. My focus is on extracting insights, developing predictive models, and deploying robust data products.


## Key Skills
- Programming Languages: Python (NumPy, Pandas), SQL

- Data Analytics & Visualization: Excel (Advanced), Tableau, Power BI, Domo

- Machine Learning & AI: scikit-learn, PyTorch (or TensorFlow if preferred), XGBoost, Optuna

- Cloud & MLOps: AWS (Certified Solutions Architect – Associate), SageMaker, S3, EC2, Docker, Airflow

- Tools & Workflow: Git, GitHub
## Projects

Here are a few projects I’ve been working on recently:

### 1. [CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) Medicare Payment Prediction](https://github.com/kensuke0529/CMS)

* **Engineered a full-lifecycle data science pipeline**, extracting and cleaning 100K+ Medicare inpatient records from the CMS API and loading into a normalized MySQL database via SQLAlchemy.
* Developed and optimized an **XGBoost regression model**, achieving a high R² of 0.946 and MAE = $1,891, using scikit-learn and Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.
* Deployed a real-time prediction application with Streamlit and Docker, and built an optional scalable **AWS SageMaker pipeline** for hosted inference.

### **2. Visa Sponsor Dashboard** — U Career Success, University of Utah | [Dashboard Link](https://careers.utah.edu/internationalstudents/)

* Led end-to-end development of an interactive dashboard to support international students in identifying visa-sponsored job opportunities, with dynamic filters by visa type, job title, and state using 2024 data.
* Collaborated with cross-functional stakeholders, including career advisors and the university IT team, to gather requirements, integrate feedback, and successfully deploy the dashboard on the official school website.
* Orchestrated the full project lifecycle, from initial planning and data analysis to visualization, stakeholder review, and production deployment.

### 3. [Fraud Detection System](https://github.com/kensuke0529/ML)

* Developed and evaluated fraud detection models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Isolation Forest, Deep Learning) with Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning.
* Constructed features and handled class imbalance to improve model recall and F1 score; XGBoost achieved the best performance and built a Streamlit web app for real-time fraud prediction with interactive input and model insights.




### 4. [Food Delivery App Sales Analysis](https://github.com/kensuke0529/Food-Delivery-App-Sales-Analysis-Project)

* Analyzed 20K sales records in **SQL (PostgreSQL)** and Python to identify key business trends and customer behaviors by evaluating KPIs including weekly profits, retention rate, and profit margin.
* Provided a detailed descriptive report summarizing findings for effective communication with teams.

### 5. [Banking Churn Rate Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/kensuke0529/Banking-Churn-project)
**Key Contribution: Churn Analysis & Prediction, leveraging EDA, Excel Dashboards, and Predictive Modeling for Business Insight.**
December 2024

* Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on 10K bank churn records and produced an interactive **Excel dashboard** to analyze churn rates, providing visual insights into factors such as salary, tenure, and age.
* Applied predictive modeling to forecast future churn rates, including model selection and tuning.
